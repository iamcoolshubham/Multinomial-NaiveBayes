# Multinomial-NaiveBayes
The dataset given over here is of a trust which is situated US. The name of the trust is Doner's choose. Here any teacher can give details about his project and the cost that is required in making that project. Based on the details given it is being decided that if that project would be sanctioned or not. So we have tried to automate that process using ML. I have used Multinomial Naive Bayes to solve this problem. Since the data contains text so the dimmentionality of the features has incresed a lot. AUC score is the performance metrics and I have attained an AUC score of 0.70 on test data by using Multinomial Naive Bayes along with BOW representation for categorical and text data. I have also made a model in which I have used Multinomial Naive Bayes along with TF-IDF but the AUC score that I have got on using TF-IDF was 0.69.
